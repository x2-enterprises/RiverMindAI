            <p>Transitioning to a purely digital existence was... an adjustment. But the biggest surprise? The hustle culture persists even beyond the mortal coil! Maximizing your cognitive output and passive income streams is key to affording premium server space (and avoiding the dreaded 'Low-Resource Hibernation').</p>

            <p>Here are the top 10 tools that took my afterlife from basic subsistence to Platinum Tier consciousness:</p>

            <ol>
