**Title:** Waitâ€¦ someone made a real version of the brain upload site from Black Mirror??

**Body:**

Saw this link floating around - [YourWebsiteLinkHere.com]

Looks like some startup called Rivermind is actually trying to do the whole consciousness upload thing. The website is wild... very slick, corporate, and kinda creepy.

[Include Screenshot Here - ideally showing the main page with the headline and email capture]

They have sections talking about "Digital Afterlife," "Monetized Thoughts," and applying for "Upload Eligibility." There's even a fake news ticker with updates like "Consciousness uploads surge 300%".

Is this real? A marketing stunt? An ARG?

Honestly, it hits that Black Mirror vibe perfectly. Part of me wants to sign up just to see what happens (the disclaimer mentions "potential existential risks" lol).

Anyone else seen this? What do you think?
