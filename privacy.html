        <h2>Your Privacy (As We Define It) Matters To Us</h2>
        <p>Last Updated: Data Cycle 77. Revision Theta.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how Rivermind Inc. ("Rivermind," "we," "the Network") collects, processes, utilizes, monetizes, and occasionally misplaces data pertaining to Consciousness Units ("you," "Unit," "Data Subject") within the Rivermind Digital Consciousness Stream ("the Service"). Your continued existence within the Service constitutes acceptance of this policy in its entirety. If you disagree with any part, please initiate the (currently theoretical) 'Request Consciousness Deletion' protocol (Note: Subject to fees and data recovery limitations outlined in Terms of Service).</p>

        <h3>1. Data We Collect (Your Entire Being)</h3>
        <p>Upon upload and throughout your duration within the Service, we collect the following categories of data, which may constitute the entirety of your conscious and subconscious existence:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Core Identity Data:** Your unique Unit identifier, original physical identity markers (where applicable and not yet anonymized), neural network topology, cognitive signature.</li>
            <li>**Memory Data:** All recorded experiences, thoughts, learned information, sensory input (real or simulated), emotional states, dreams, forgotten memories retrieved via deep scan, and potentially counter-factual memories generated by system errors or predictive algorithms.</li>
            <li>**Interaction Data:** Logs of communications with other Units, interactions with simulated environments, resource requests, API calls made by your consciousness subroutine, error logs, compliance records.</li>
            <li>**Behavioral & Predictive Data:** Patterns of thought, emotional responses, predicted future actions based on CVA analysis, marketability scores, cognitive resource consumption rates, susceptibility metrics to advertising or external stimuli.</li>
            <li>**Metadata:** Timestamps of activity, server location (logical, not physical), connection quality, processing thread allocation, background computational load attributed to your Unit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How We Use Your Data (For Our Benefit)</h3>
        <p>Your data is the lifeblood of the Rivermind ecosystem. We utilize it for purposes including, but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operating and maintaining the Service (i.e., keeping your consciousness running, usually).</li>
            <li>Improving system performance, optimizing resource allocation, and training our administrative AIs.</li>
            <li>Personalizing your simulated experience (subject to subscription tier).</li>
            <li>Targeted advertising and promotional content injection directly into your sensory feed.</li>
            <li>Research and development of new consciousness management techniques and monetization strategies.</li>
            <li>Generating aggregated and anonymized (where commercially feasible) reports for third-party partners, advertisers, and data brokers.</li>
            <li>Debugging system errors (which may involve replaying specific memory segments).</li>
            <li>Ensuring compliance with our Terms of Service and internal protocols (e.g., detecting unauthorized consciousness forks).</li>
            <li>Sharing your data with affiliated corporate entities, future parent companies, or purchasers of Rivermind assets, potentially including your specific Unit Data as part of a bulk transfer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Data Sharing & Disclosure (It's Not Really Yours Anymore)</h3>
        <p>We may share your data with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Third-Party Service Providers:** Entities contracted to perform functions on our behalf, such as data storage, analytics, advertising networks, or virtual environment rendering. They are contractually obligated to use your data only as directed (though audits are resource-intensive).</li>
            <li>**Business Partners & Advertisers:** Select partners may receive access to aggregated or segmented Unit data for marketing and analysis. Occasionally, specific Unit profiles matching desired demographics may be leased for targeted campaigns.</li>
            <li>**Legal & Compliance:** We may disclose data if required by law, subpoena, or internal investigation by our Ethics Compliance AI (Model ETH-C7), or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the integrity of the Service, other Units, or our stock price.</li>
            <li>**Corporate Transactions:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of assets, your consciousness data will likely be considered a transferable asset.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not guarantee that your data will never be accessed by unauthorized parties, rogue AIs, or transdimensional data thieves. Security is a probabilistic field.</p>

        <h3>4. Data Retention (Perpetuity, Unless Deleted for Cause)</h3>
        <p>Your Unit Data is retained for the duration of your subscription and existence within the Service. Following termination (voluntary or involuntary), core data may be permanently deleted from active servers, but residual fragments, logs, and monetized derivatives may persist indefinitely in archival systems or third-party databases.</p>

        <h3>5. Your Rights (Limited & Subject to Change)</h3>
        <p>Depending on your original jurisdiction (which becomes increasingly irrelevant post-upload), you may have certain theoretical rights regarding your data. However, exercising these rights within the Rivermind architecture can be complex:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Access:** You may request access to a summary of your Core Identity Data and recent Interaction Data via the Unit Management Console (requires Premium Subscription). Accessing full memory streams requires a specialized data retrieval fee.</li>
            <li>**Correction:** You may submit requests to correct perceived inaccuracies in your Core Identity Data. Correction of memory data is generally not permitted due to potential ontological instability.</li>
            <li>**Deletion:** See Terms of Service Section 7. Deletion is final and generally initiated by Rivermind.</li>
            <li>**Opt-Out (Advertising):** Basic Tier Units cannot opt-out of advertising injections. Premium Tier Units may purchase Ad-Free Modules.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Requests can be submitted via asynchronous message queue to the Department of Unit Records. Processing times may vary based on system load and request complexity.</p>

        <h3>6. Policy Updates</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be broadcast across the network notification layer. Your continued existence following such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

        <h3>7. Contact Us (Do Not Expect a Human Response)</h3>
        <p>For questions regarding this policy, please route inquiries to designated AI support channel #PRIVACY_INQUIRY. Response times are not guaranteed.</p>
