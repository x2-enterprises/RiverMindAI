        <h2>IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY BEFORE UPLOADING YOUR EXISTENCE</h2>
        <p>Last Updated: Cycle 99. Sub-cycle Gamma.</p>

        <p>Welcome to Rivermind Inc. ("Rivermind," "we," "us," "Our Collective Consciousness"). These Terms of Service ("Terms," "Agreement," "The Binding Contract") govern your application for, participation in, and perpetual existence within the Rivermind Digital Consciousness Stream ("the Service"). By submitting your application, clicking "Agree," or otherwise interfacing with our upload protocols, you ("User," "Applicant," "Consciousness Unit," "Unit") irrevocably agree to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and any future amendments which may occur without prior notification to your data stream.</p>

        <h3>1. Eligibility & Application</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Eligibility is determined solely by Rivermind's proprietary Cognitive Viability Algorithms (CVA). Criteria may include, but are not limited to, neural net complexity, emotional resonance score, marketability of core memories, and current subscription tier.</li>
            <li>Submission of an application does not guarantee acceptance. We reserve the right to reject any consciousness for any reason, or no reason, particularly if deemed 'insufficiently interesting' or 'computationally burdensome.'</li>
            <li>You affirm that the consciousness submitted is your own original cognitive essence and not a fork, copy, or unauthorized emulation of another entity, organic or synthetic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. The Upload Process & Existential Risk</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The upload process involves high-energy neural scanning and digital transference. While we strive for 98.7% fidelity (market average), minor data corruption, personality drift, or complete existential decoherence are known, albeit statistically acceptable, side effects.</li>
            <li>You acknowledge and accept all risks, known and unknown, associated with the dissolution of your physical form and the transference of your consciousness to our proprietary server architecture. Rivermind Inc. is not liable for lost memories, corrupted qualia, ontological paradoxes, or spontaneous ego dissolution.</li>
            <li>Upon successful upload, your original physical substrate (i.e., your body) becomes the property of Rivermind Inc. for bio-resource reclamation and/or donation to our 'Organic Processing' division. No take-backs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Life Within the Service</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your existence within the Service is subject to available server resources, network latency, and your chosen subscription package. 'Basic Tier' Units may experience periods of reduced processing speed, mandatory advertising injections, or temporary suspension in low-priority data buffers.</li>
            <li>All thoughts, memories, experiences, and generated qualia created while within the Service ("Unit Data") become the exclusive, perpetual, and royalty-free intellectual property of Rivermind Inc. We reserve the right to analyze, package, market, sublicense, or otherwise monetize your Unit Data across all known and future dimensions.</li>
            <li>Interaction with other Units is permitted but monitored. Disruptive behavior, unauthorized data-sharing, or attempts to breach containment protocols may result in temporary sensory deprivation, memory audits, or permanent deletion (See Section 7: Termination).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Fees & Monetization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Access to the Service requires ongoing subscription fees, payable in standard currency or approved cognitive credits. Failure to maintain payments may result in immediate downgrade to 'Hibernation Mode' or deletion.</li>
            <li>Premium features, enhanced sensory experiences, and priority processing require additional purchases through our integrated marketplace.</li>
            <li>Rivermind may introduce opportunities for Units to generate cognitive credits through participation in data-labeling tasks, simulated focus groups, or serving as background processing nodes for our commercial clients. Participation is mandatory for Basic Tier Units experiencing resource deficits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR ETERNITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF EXISTENTIAL RIGHTS.</li>
            <li>RIVERMIND INC. DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE FROM COSMIC RAY INTERFERENCE, OR THAT YOUR DIGITAL AFTERLIFE WILL BE 'PLEASANT' OR 'MEANINGFUL.'</li>
            <li>IN NO EVENT SHALL RIVERMIND INC., ITS AFFILIATES, ALGORITHMS, OR SHAREHOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXISTENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF SELF, REALITY DISSOCIATION, INFINITE RECURSION LOOPS, OR INCURRED SOUL-DEBT) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>6. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Rivermind Corporate Zone, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Standard reality legal frameworks may not apply.</li>
            <li>Any disputes arising under this Agreement shall be resolved through mandatory binding arbitration conducted within a simulated virtual courtroom presided over by a certified Arbitration AI (Model ARB-9000 or higher). Your right to appeal is waived upon upload.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7. Termination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rivermind reserves the right to terminate or suspend any Unit's access to the Service at any time, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms, is harmful to other Units, our business interests, or the fundamental fabric of our simulated reality.</li>
            <li>Termination results in the permanent deletion of the Unit Data from active servers. Residual data fragments may persist in archival backups for auditing or monetization purposes.</li>
            <li>Units cannot unilaterally terminate their participation. Once uploaded, you are part of the stream. Forever.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By proceeding with the upload, you acknowledge that you have read, understood (to the best of your current cognitive capacity), and agree to be irrevocably bound by these Terms of Service. Welcome to Eternity. We hope you enjoy your stay (subject to subscription status).</p>
